## Overview

To strengthen security across various applications, I implemented a robust JWT authentication system. This setup enhances user data protection, ensuring secure access control across multiple frontend and backend services. The JWT approach was chosen for its scalability and adaptability, making it suitable for projects with large user bases.

## Key Features

- JWT-Based Authentication: Enabled secure and scalable authentication, allowing verified access while minimizing server load.
- User Role Management: Developed access controls to manage user permissions effectively, ensuring restricted areas are protected.
- Enhanced Security: Implemented token expiration and refresh mechanisms to maintain security and protect against unauthorized access.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js & Express: For backend API development and middleware configuration.
- JWT: For secure, scalable token-based authentication.
- MongoDB: To store user credentials and role information securely.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was managing token expiration and refresh logic without disrupting the user experience. Fine-tuning this process and handling edge cases, such as token hijacking, improved the systemâ€™s resilience.

## Outcome

The JWT authentication system has greatly improved security across projects, making it scalable for future needs. It has received positive feedback for its effectiveness in protecting user data and managing permissions.
